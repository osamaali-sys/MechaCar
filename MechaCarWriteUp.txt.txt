# MPG Regression
Ho = m=0
H1 = m is not 0



First we created the multiple linear regression model for mpg prediction:

mpg = 6.27*vlength + 0*vweight + 0.07*spangle + 3.55*grclearance - 3.41*AWD - 104

Vehicle weight and spoiler angle has little to no effect on mpg of a vehicle

mpg = 6.27*vlength + 3.55*grclearance - 3.41*AWD - 104

Vehicle length, ground clearance and AWD have an impact on an mpg of the vehicle.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?  Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model for vehicle weight, angle, and AWD are 0. We are accepting null hypothesis for these variables

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?
Being that intercept (p=5.08e-08) is also statistically significant,
there are other variables and factors that are contributing to variations that is not included in our model.

p value is significant, 5.35x10^-11, smaller than 0.05 significance level, so sufficent evidence to reject null hypothesis
r-squared = .71, 71% of all mpg predictions will be correct when using this linear model.




Despite that, according to the summary output, the r-squared value of our multiple
linear regression model is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of all mpg predictions
will be correct while using this regression model.

In addition, the p-value of our linear regression is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller
than our assumed significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we can state that there is
sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slopes of 
a multiple linear regressions model are not zero for 3 variables: vlength, 
grclearance and AWD.

# Suspension Coil Summary

Suspension coil presented in the dataset is normally distributed and densely gathered
around the mean and median which are equal to 1498.78 and 1500 respectively.

Standard Deviation of the PSI variable is very small 7.89.
Variance of the PSI sample distribution is 62.29 which is smaller than 100 pounds per
inch so our suspension coils data meets the design specifications for the MechaCar.

# Suspension Coil T-Test

H0: There is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its
population mean.
Ha: There is a statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its
population mean.
Population mean is 1500 pounds per inch.

P-value we've calculated using R-language t.test() function is 0.06.
Assuming our significance level was the common 0.05 percent, our p-value is above
that significance level. Therefore we don't have sufficient evidence to reject our
null hypothesis, so we would state that our dataset mean and population mean are
statistically similar. This also means that our suspension coils dataset is 
statistically representative.

# Design your own study

To put our Prototype in a competitive sales standpoint, we need to have MPG advantage
over the competitors. We would test our performance in different environments and road conditions.
We would also need to gather out competitors mpg data for comparison, if possible using the same parameters.

With growing variety in the automotive industry we would need modern vibrant colors for our vehicle.
Also need to consider performance and tech optional addons, such as leather seats, bluetooth, surround sound
speakers, lane assist etc.

Our hypothesis would be the following:
H0: There is no statistical difference between our mpg dataset and other
vehicles mpg dataset on the market.
Ha: The true mean of our mpg dataset is GREATER than the mean of our competitors
fuel efficiency values dataset.

We would need to use a paired t-test to compare our datasets providing the following
parameters:
x - our prototype vehicle mpg dataset as vector of numbers;
y - our competitors mpg values dataset as vector of numbers;
paired - must be set to TRUE since we're comparing two sets;
alternative - must be set to "greater" or "g" to specify that our alternative 
hypothesis states that x mean is greater than y mean.

If the resulting p-value would be smaller than 0.05 we would have enougth 
statistical evidence to reject our null hypothesis and state that our Ha is true,
which would mean that our prototype vehicle outperforms the competition in fuel
efficiency.
